''' 
Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascalâ€™s triangle.
'''

'''
Time Complexity: O(n*r), where n is the given row number, and r is the column index which can vary from 0 to n-1.
Reason: We are calculating the element for each column. Now, there are total n columns, and for each column, the calculation of the element takes O(r) time where r is the column index.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
